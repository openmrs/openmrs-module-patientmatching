openmrs-module-patientmatching
==============================

Patient Matching is a very specific application. In this module we try to identify records that belong to the same patient among different data sources. These sources can range from patient data collected at different hospitals to external information from governmental institutions, e.g. a death master file etc...

What The Module Does
====================

This OpenMRS module wraps around the patientmatching jar file to facilitate creating the matching file setup and merging patients that are found to be duplicates.
