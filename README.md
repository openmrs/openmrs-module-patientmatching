OpenMRS-module-patientmatching
==============================

Patient matching is a specific type of application, in which we try to identify those records that belong to the same patient among different data sources. These sources can range from the  patient data poised at different hospitals to external information from the governmental institutions, such as death master file etc.

What Does The Module Do
=======================

This OpenMRS Module wraps around the patientmatching jar to facilitate creating the matching file setup and merging the patients that are found to be duplicates.
